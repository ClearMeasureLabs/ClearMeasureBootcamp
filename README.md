# Clear Measure Bootcamp 

**This project is the starting point for folks taking part in the Clear Measure 
Bootcamp.** 

This course is a feature-driven walkthrough that guides participants through
a series of improvements to an existing code base, demonstrating best pracitices and 
and working through scenarios targetting 300- and 400-level developers.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo
- Configure your db (see pre-requisites below)
- Run the click to build script
- **Build** the application in Visual Studio 2015
- **Run** the application from VS

## Application Overview

The starting point is an expense report application with a very limited feature set, and
room to improve. You will work through defining and prioritizing new features, then work 
in pairs to build these out. Your product owner/trainer/engineering manager will present you with new requirements
while you map out how things will be built, pair programming and working through a series
of iterations, writing tests and leveraging CI. Roll up the sleeves!
